 I am a developer who knows how to do a little bit of everything: from beautiful buttons to scary SQL queries.<br>If something is broken, it means that I am no longer working on it. If it 's not broken ....<br> Back... well, at least he's trying to look confident.<br> I make the interfaces beautiful, the servers lively, and the bugs<br>well.... I write the code so that in a month I can figure out for myself what I meant.
